# begging-for-money-for-purchasing-supercomputer
A begging video

Depositer(s) will be remembered forever. and recorded. Currently preparing something in progress, despite the progress is too slow like a snail.

[Reason? why?]
(0) My workstation is too old. It served me already more than 7 years, and reached to its limitation that the tasks I'm currently doing are too heavy for this. So I want to retire this workstation, and maybe let it be in peace with lighter workload, maybe um .. it seems enterprise grade required.
(1) Maybe if I purchase supercomputer and if there are remaining money then.. maybe I want to buy cat food to feed my cat and also myself because I became a jobless from Oct 2023, and mostly I'm in starvation, lost my muscles and so many other health-wise things, I unexpectedly confronted that my height was shrunk when my father visited my room and accidentally compared myself to him that he is now taller than me at the moment despite I was taller than him in the past, so it seems I'm currently getting defuncted.
(2) and um .. maybe if the depositors contribution is well enough maybe ... going to buy another necessary appliances as well as feeding my cat(s).
(3) Due to some reason I cannot reveal all the things but gradually I want to share the things what I was/am doing with the depositors, if they are willing to, and I also understand there is possibility that depositors may not want to reveal themselves, or sometimes don't even want to know what I am doing, so then .. um .. maybe need to make a form related to PI, or .. um ..
